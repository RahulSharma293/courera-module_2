                <p>
                  Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in
                  comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have
                  become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has
                  been variously adapted to regional tastes.

                <p>
                    Beef is first divided into primal cuts, pieces of meat initially butchering.
                    These are basic sections from which steaks and other subdivisions are cut.
                    The term "primal cut" is quite different from "prime cut", used to characterize cuts considered to be of higher quality.
                    Since the animal's legs and neck muscles do the most work.

                <p>
                  Sushi is vinegared rice topped with other ingredients. Sashimi, which is slices of raw fish alone,
                  is not sushi because it isn't accompanied with rice. ... The word “sushi” means “it's sour,” which reflects back to sushi's origins of being preserved in salt.
